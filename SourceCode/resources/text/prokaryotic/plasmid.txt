Circular DNA moleculars, usually supercoiling DNA, but not as long as chromosome and not contain the main gene-cassette for the reproduction process. Gene in plasmid usually brings an extraordinary ability to the cell, such as superabsorption, drug-resitance. Plasmid can be self-replicated independently to the chromosomes' DNA There are many types of plasmid in a genre of cell, contributes in many important functions to cell's life.
