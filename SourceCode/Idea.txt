Current work:
- draw a chromosome of eukaryotic with the following SVGPath: M 0 0 Q -4 -25 -12 -25 C -11 -17 -7 -11 -5 -1 C -8 8 -11 15 -11 23 Q -7 22 0 0
- Run simple animation of this chromosome.
- Current idea: draw chromosome in Scene builder, give it an fx:id, create a corresponding attribute in controller, manipulate through draw() method.
- Create animation by update the coordinate through state class.
Drawbacks:
- too many attributes(8 chromosome, each with X, y, rotation angle, visibility)
- manipulates all of them takes a lot of programming
- the coordinate is still hard coded, doesn't take the panel size into considerations.
- still stucks at the divided to 2 cells.
Some ideas but haven't implemented yet:
- Create an ArrrayList for chromosome, circle, rectangle, spindle, ... to handle dynamically instead of hard code (create all of them at the start and manipulate by visibility)
Problem with this approach: how to add to view, coordinate, ...
- Create a HBox with multiple AnchorPane, each AnchorPane for one cells, when divide the cell add another AnchorPane to HBox.
Problem: just an idea with multiple issues.
- Update coordinate based on AnchorPane height and width, not hard coded number.
- Animation at anaphase, where chromatids split to 2 spindles, make them move along a curve instead with PathTransition instead of TranslateTransition
problem: pretty hard to design condition.
Note: this is still pretty vague, sorry :)
