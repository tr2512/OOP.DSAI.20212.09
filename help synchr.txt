C.E.O (Cell Easy Option)
v1.0.2

Welcome users to the natural cell program. By this tool, you
will have a holistic overview about prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
cell and its functional components
In the first interface screen, you will see 4 buttons that 
consecutively arranged clock-wise: Prokaryotic, Eukaryotic, Help
and Quit.
- Prokaryotic (tế bào nhân sơ): enter in. users see the 
prokaryotic cell, its components and how it self-divide by 
amitosis(cytokinesis).
- Eukaryotic (tế bào nhân thực): enter in. users see the 
eukaryotic cell, its components and the methods of cell division:
mitosis and meiosis.
- Help: enter in the help menu to see the instructions.
- Quit: A pane will show up to ask whether you really want 
to quit the program or not. 

//<trong phần này mà làm thêm một pane chứa mặt các thành viên trong team rồi vai trò nữa được thì tốt>

>>> helpCell()
Here you see the components of prokaryotic/eukaryotic cells.

To see the description of the cell's functional components, drag 
your mouse around the components to find a lighten orange dot. 
Click in, the program shows up a box on the righthandside, which 
contains the information of a single component and its 
contribution to the way how the cell works.


>>>helpCellDivision()
Continue. This part of program will show a simulation 
that simplify the process of cell division. There are 3 types:
amitosis related to Prokaryotic cell, mitosis and meiosis related
to Eukaryotic cell.

In the window screen of each method of cell division, there 
are 2 buttons [prev] and [forward] to let users freely switching 
between phases of a complete division. There is also a bar
of progress located between 2 buttons to show the milestone-
phases had been passed through.
